Methods for "deep" interaction with Python dicts
------------------------------------------------

I recently rediscovered the Python dictionary and found new uses for this data
structure in my projects. However, I quickly ran into a bottlemneck where
nested dictionaries were difficult to access and very challenging to modify.
So, this repository demonstrates some methods for getting nested dictionaries,
adding a nested dictionary, and replacing a particular key-value nested
anywhere in the dict.

Feel free to contribute or provide some feedback!
